  <p>References to we/our/us are to Vairt. Vairt will incorporate, and administer on your behalf, an Intermediate Special Purpose Vehicle (ISPV) in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) to hold your investment interest in a property (a Property being an apartment, villa or house that investors may invest in or have invested in). References to you/your are references to the user of the Website for the purpose of investing in Property using our crowdfunding platform (the Investor).</p>
<p>By continuing to use the Website, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions and the following policies:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vairt Cookie Policy</p>
<p>2. Vairt Privacy Policy</p>
<p>3. Vairt Website General Terms of use</p>
<p>In addition, you acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood the Key Risk and disclosure detailed in the Knowledge Hub on our Website.</p>
<p>Vairt is Delaware based company with offices in United States, Europe and Middle East.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
<p>Vairt manages the Website. The Website provides information on properties which you may elect to invest in by acquiring shares (each a Share and together, the Shares) in an ISPV established for the sole purpose of acquiring and owning an individual Property. Vairt will administer and manage the ISPV for you within limited parameters under an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement). The form of Administration Agreement is set out at Schedule 2 to this Agreement. By agreeing to the terms of this Agreement you are hereby agreeing to the terms of the Administration Agreement.</p>
<p>We will conduct fundraising rounds (each an Investment Round) through the Website pursuant to which we will seek to secure a pre-agreed minimum amount for each Property from various investors (the Total Funding Target) in exchange for the Shares. The Total Funding Target will be the sale price of the Property as agreed between us and the seller of the Property (the Seller). Vairt will verify the sale price of each Property with an independent valuer, who will provide a full report on each Property together with all costs and fees which will arise in the acquisition of the Property, as well as any forecasted expenses. The Total Funding Target, along with all expenses pertaining to the purchase of each Property, will be set out in detail on the Website.</p>
<p>You agree to invest money in exchange for a percentage of the Shares issued by the ISPV, conditional on the Total Funding Target being achieved. By subscribing for ISPV shares in an Investment Round, you confirm you understand and agree the fees and charges which have been notified to you on the Website. You will be required to reconfirm this at the point of funding. To the extent you are unclear on any element of the funding process please contact [investments@vairt.com] and we will revert to you within 24 hours of receipt of your email.</p>
<p>If the Total Funding Target is achieved and the Investment Round completes you will be sent a share certificate representing your Shares. If the Total Funding Target is not achieved within the relevant time period, all committed funds will be returned, without deduction of any fees or expenses, your Vairt Account (Vairt Account). You can then choose to use the returned funds towards another Property or withdraw the funds from your Vairt Account entirely. Please note where you initiate a withdrawal of funds from your Vairt Account via the Website, we will return your funds to the bank account which you used to fund your Vairt Account. Your Vairt Account is a segregated account operated by PNC, Mashreqbank or any other bank mentioned, as further detailed in Section 8 below.We accept no responsibility and disclaim all liability for any information about a Property made available to you through Website</p>
<h4>THE INVESTMENT &amp; PREORDER TERMS</h4>
<p>You agree to invest money in exchange for Shares relevant to the Property you are interested in on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this Agreement. Each Investment Round will include an indicative term for holding the Property (the Investment Term). Prior to the end of the Investment Term, we will undertake a valuation of the Property and you will be asked to vote on whether you want the ISPV to sell the Property or extend the Investment Term. Please refer to section [12] for details on this voting process. At the launch of each Investment Round, Vairt will appoint a Property Manager for each Property (the Property Manager). The details of the Property Manager will be provided via the Vairt platform. Where the Property Manager believes it to be necessary, owing to market conditions, to amend the Investment Term, we will advise you accordingly and provide you and your co-investors an opportunity to vote to amend the Investment Term. An amendment to an Investment Term may result in the sale of a Property earlier than previously agreed or later than previously agreed.</p>
<p>You will agree to the initial proposed Investment Term and the Property Manager prior to making any investment in a Property, via the Vairt platform.</p>
<p>The minimum investment amount in most cases is $1500, although we reserve the right to increase this amount for Properties with higher Total Funding Targets.</p>
<p>In making an investment you agree that you have done so solely based on information contained on the Website, together with any independent knowledge that you may have and professional advice that you may have received. Nothing we have done, nor anything that is on the Website, is to be construed as advice or a recommendation by us in relation to an investment. You agree that you have complete control and discretion as to whether or not you invest through the Website.</p>
<p>By selecting a Property to invest in through the Website, you agree to invest in such Property through the ownership Shares. We will combine your transaction to purchase Shares with other investors that have also purchased Shares in the relevant ISPV.</p>
<p>Investment in real estate is speculative. The market value of a Property can fall, and rental income is not guaranteed. You must be prepared to invest for the full investment period, owing to a lack of market for the Property interest. You also acknowledge that it may be difficult to sell the Property at the end of the Investment Term.</p>
<p>Your percentage of Shares will be calculated in relation to the value of the Property, less all other acquisition costs and fees which will arise in the acquisition of the Property. For example, if the Total Funding Target is $500,000 and you have invested $ 5,000, excluding fees related to completing the purchase of the Property, you will acquire 1% of the Shares.</p>
<p>The purchase and transaction costs include but are not limited to Vairt fees and statutory fees (such as the No Objection Certificate fee and Utility bill deposits), Dubai Land Department ("DLD") transfer fees and brokerage fees. These are calculated separately and have no bearing on your ownership percentage in the ISPV and therefore the Property. These costs are calculated in proportion to the percentage of Shares you own in the relevant ISPV.</p>
<p>Vairt has the discretion to reduce the Total Funding Target at any time if it reasonably considers this is in the interest of investors (in the event, for example, that a reduced sale price is negotiated with the Seller).</p>
<p>Completion of an investment will be conditional on the following:</p>
<p>Total Funding Target being raised during the Investment Round;</p>
<p>You having agreed to purchase the Shares;</p>
<p>The Seller completing the sale of their Property to the ISPV; and</p>
<p>Vairt n o t having exercised i t s discretion to terminate any Property acquisition process.</p>
<p>Vairt reserves the right not to list a Property for sale, to decline investment requests and/or bid requests via its Website at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>No single Investor will be entitled to secure more than 24.99% of a given investment opportunity.</p>
<h4>MATERIAL CHANGES</h4>
<p>A Material Change means any change or new matter that may significantly affect the value of the Property, the ability to rent the Property, the return on the Property or the value of the Investment.</p>
<p>If a Material Change occurs during the commitment period, Vairt will disclose prominently on its website details of the material change; notify committed investors of the material change and require them to reconfirm their commitment within 5 business days; and if reconfirmation is not provided within 5 business days, cancel the commitment.</p>
<p>The commitment period is to be the period from your investment in the property on the Website until the transaction is completed, meaning the property has been transferred from Seller to the Investors</p>
<p>If a Material Change occurs after the commitment period, Vairt will disclose prominently on its website, details of the material change; any change in the rights of investors, arising from the material change; and what steps, if any, Vairt is proposing to take as a result of such change.</p>
<h4>RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT</h4>
<p>Once you have made an investment and purchased Shares, any distribution you receive from the Shares will be paid to you and placed in a third-party escrow account operated by Global Currency Exchange Network Limited (GCEN) and/or ENBD third party client money account, the balance of which will be visible to you on the Website as available funds. Subject to our being satisfied with your then current compliance with our know your customer and anti-money laundering processes, you may then choose to withdraw this money at any time or re-invest in other properties in a similar manner as set out in this Agreement. Your information is also verified by Global Custodial Services Limited (GCS). Please see Schedule 1 for further information on GCEN and GCS.</p>
<p>We wish to draw your attention to the risks relating to investing in Shares, which can be found on our Website. Please note that the distribution of dividends depends on many factors (such as whether there is a tenant for the Property). The value of Shares may go down as well as up and the past performance of any investment is not an indicator of future performance nor is a forecast a reliable indicator of future performance. Dividends will be paid based on total rent less fees including but not limited to: service charges, management fees (after the testing period), Vairt annual fees and maintenance and insurance. You will be provided with a full breakdown of these at the time of making your investment and on an ongoing basis on the Website.</p>
<p>There will be a time lag of one to three months between the receipt of rent and dividend payouts to ensure there is liquidity available to pay for any maintenance or service charges to avoid asking investors to inject further capital. Dividends will be paid directly into your Vairt Account. You may then choose to withdraw this money at any time or re-invest in other properties in a similar manner as set out in this Agreement.</p>
<p>If payments by a tenant are overdue the Property Manager will endeavour to recover the outstanding amounts. If after one month a tenant is still in default of payment the Property Manager will advise you and your co-investors of their recommended course of action by the Website and by email. Courses of action may include legal proceedings against the tenant. Investors will vote on the next course of action and where fees to recover the amounts are to be incurred, you and your co-investors will bear the cost. An attempt to reclaim all legal fees from the tenant will be made with a view to repaying you and your co-investors.</p>
<p>You may have to pay other taxes or costs, which are not imposed by us. You should seek your own independent tax advice, where necessary.</p>
<h4>ISPV</h4>
<p>Vairt will form an ISPV for the purposes of holding your investment. You will hold Shares in the ISPV.</p>
<p>By entering into this Agreement, you confirm the ISPV will be managed by Vairt under the Administration Agreement, subject to the articles of association for the ISPV (the Articles).</p>
<p>Pursuant to this agreement you authorize Vairt and its Directors to sign any related documents for the ISPV including but not limited to articles of association, relationship declaration, transfer of shares, ordinary shareholder resolution, divestment of investments, appointment of authorize signatory on your behalf.</p>
<p>The form of Articles of the ISPV is available on your personal dashboard, as accessed through the Website and included in Schedule 3 of this agreement.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and irrevocably agree that you shall not be entitled to direct the management of the ISPV as a result of your ownership of Shares, including in respect of any direction to transfer or otherwise dispose of those Shares, other than as is set out in this Agreement, the Articles and the Administration Agreement.</p>
<h4>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML)</h4>
<p>Money laundering is the process of disguising illegally obtained money so that the funds appear to come from legitimate sources or activities. Money laundering occurs in connection with a wide variety of crimes, including illegal arms sales, drug trafficking, robbery, fraud, racketeering, securities fraud and terrorism.</p>
<p>As per the DFSA AML Rules and in accordance with UAE Federal AML Laws, Vairt has implemented a robust Anti Money Laundering framework to ensure that Vairt mitigates the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing activity through its platform. Vairt's AML framework includes, but is not limited to, the designation of a Money Laundering Reporting Officer, employee AML training and the implementation of a Customer Due Diligence process. As part of our customer due diligence process, you will be asked to provide various information and documentation in order for Vairt to verify your identity and your sources of wealth and income. Until you provide the information or documents and until your identity has been verified, you may not be able to open an account or effect any transactions through the Vairt platform.</p>
<h4>YOUR MONEY</h4>
<p>The Website allows you to fund your Vairt Account, which can then be used by you to purchase Shares via the Website. Until such time as you invest the money you transfer to us to purchase Shares or commit to purchase Shares, it will remain your money and (subject to completion of know your customer and anti-money laundering processes) can be withdrawn by you at any time.</p>
<p>We may suspend or place limitations on your Vairt Account at any time if we believe it is appropriate in order to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations or the terms of these Investor Terms. This may include periods where we need to obtain additional client identification documents, and / or your country of residence changes to a jurisdiction outside of which Vairt does business. For more details about how we use your information, please refer to our privacy policy at our website.</p>
<p>We shall hold any money we receive from you in accordance with the DFSA's rules, which require that we hold client money (a term used interchangeably with client monies) in a client bank account segregated from our own funds.</p>
<p>Client Money is held by Vairt in a segregated Client Account with GCS and/or ENBD. GCS is a UK company, authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and holds Part IV Permissions under the FSMA 2000. Registration number 595875, as such GCS are fully regulated to hold money for the purpose of investment. Whilst GCS is accountable to Vairt for the safe keeping of its client money, GCS does not have a relationship with Vairts clients directly. Therefore, Vairt is wholly accountable for our investors client money. Vairt has undertaken due diligence of GCS's custodial systems and controls and deemed them fit and proper to hold client money on Vairt behalf.</p>
<p>Clients of Vairt are subject to the protection conferred by the DFSA's Client Money Provisions and as a consequence:</p>
<p>this Money will be held separate from Money belonging to Vairt; and in the event of the Authorized Firm's insolvency, winding up or other distribution event stipulated by the DFSA, the Client's Money will be subject to the DFSA's Client Money Distribution Rules.</p>
<p>Interest on Client Money is not payable to you as a Client of Vairt.</p>
<p>As noted above Client Money might be held in the UK and UAE, outside the DIFC and the market practices, insolvency and legal regime applicable in that jurisdiction may differ from the regime applicable in the DIFC.</p>
<p>We shall exercise due skill, care and diligence in the selection, appointment and periodic review of any credit institution or bank (other than a central bank) where the client money is deposited and for the arrangements for holding the client money, but we shall not be responsible for any acts, omissions or default of any such credit institution or bank.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and accept that your money may be pooled with money belonging to other clients, which means that you will not have a claim against a specific sum in a specific account, but against the client money pool in general.</p>
<p>You will be able to review your Vairt balance via your personalized dashboard on the Website.</p>
<p>You will be free to transfer funds into the Client Monies Account by bank transfer or cheque. You cannot make cash deposits. We require you to use an account held with a UAE or international bank and which is maintained in your sole or name or jointly with another person, or in the name of the business or organization you represent, with an IBAN number or foreign equivalent</p>
<p>You may only withdraw funds from your Vairt Account in excess of the minimum investment amount. Funds may only be paid into your specified UAE or international bank account with a valid IBAN number (or foreign equivalent) and which is maintained in your sole name or jointly with another person.</p>
<p>The funds will be wired to you in the respective currency of your Vairt Account. We bear no responsibility of any foreign exchange losses or any fees charged by your bank or any correspondence bank.</p>
<p>At our discretion, we may offer interest or a promotional benefit to you. Where we do so it will be made clear on the Website and may be payable as follows:</p>
<p>When you purchase Shares, you may receive an amount equivalent to the indicated Dividend Yield on the amounts invested in shares in the Property, pro-rata according to the number of days between the date the instruction to invest was made and the end of the funding period.</p>
<p>During the period between the Property moving to the Resale market and the Property Manager securing tenants, you may accrue an amount equivalent to the respective Dividend Yield on the amount invested in shares in the Property (again, on a pro-rata basis). This amount will be paid directly into your Vairt account, for the month the benefit accrued, on the 5th of the following month (or the next business day if the 5th of the month falls on the weekend or a bank holiday). Note, that if you sell your shares during this period, you will lose any entitlement to this benefit.</p>
<h4>MAKING THE INVESTMENT PAYMENT</h4>
<p>In order to commit to making an investment in a Property via our Website, you will first have to fund your Vairt Account into the segregated client money account of Vairt (as outlined in further detail in section above) at least equal to the amount required to make the investment (Investment Amount) via the Website.</p>
<p>Once you have indicated, via the Website, that you wish to proceed with the investment in a Property and purchase Shares you will not be entitled to withdraw your committed funds that will be used to purchase the Shares from the client money account unless you have validly exercised the withdrawal rights set out in section above, or the Total Funding Target is not achieved, and the Investment Round does not complete. In these scenarios, your Vairt Account balance would be restored, and you could either withdraw these funds (subject to completion of know your customer and anti-money laundering processes) or invest in another Property.</p>
<p>The aggregate Investment Amounts will be used to fund the acquisition of the Property (indirectly through the acquisition of Shares), plus any forecast expenses as set out on the Website and would therefore be removed from the client money account on completion of such acquisition.</p>
<p>You may fund your Vairt Account by wire transfer. Any processing and transfer charges and fees will be for your account. We reserve the right to reject the money if we are not satisfied with your compliance with our AML requirements or if you have failed to provide the right reference number at the time of transfer. After the deposit has been paid, the remaining funds for the relevant percentage of Interests in the Property (as set out in the Investment Round) are to be wired within 7 days. If we do not receive the additional funds within this 7-day period, we will refund you and you will lose the right to participate in the investment in the Property.</p>
<p>For UAE residents we only accept payments in AED for investments denominated in AED. All non-UAE residents are requested to make payments in USD for all AED denominated investments. The exchange rate that will be applied to convert AED to USD will be 0.27352 or otherwise stated on the platform. Any transfer fees charged by your bank or correspondence bank must be your responsibility. The net amount received by us will be reflected in your wallet</p>
<p>For any non AED denominated investments, the payments will be required in the respective currency. You might be able to make payments in AED, USD or the respective currency. The exchange rates for such payments will be provided on the website and our communication to you. Any transfer fees charged by your bank or correspondence bank must be your responsibility. The net amount received by us will be reflected in your wallet.</p>
<p>We accept no responsibility for any foreign exchange loses and advise you to see external advice before making any foreign currency transactions.</p>
<h4>WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS</h4>
<p>You may exercise your right to withdraw from an investment up to 48 hours ("cooling off period") from the date of your decision to invest by notice on the website, emailing us at [info@smartcrowd.ae] or calling us on [+971 50 2883149].</p>
<p>If you exercise your withdrawal rights in accordance with section [10.1] above, you will be entitled to withdraw the Investment Amount from the client money account subject to completion of know your customer and anti-money laundering processes.</p>
<p>If you exercise your withdrawal rights in accordance with section [10.1] above, you will not be entitled to any promotional benefits that may have normally applied to the investment you are withdrawing from, nor will you be entitled to any dividends, interest or other benefit. For the avoidance of doubt, if you withdraw, you shall only be entitled to the return of the sum you invested.</p>
<p>You do not have a right to cancel in circumstances where you acquire or dispose of a beneficial interest in shares via our secondary market because you will be doing so from or to another investor who has offered their shares for sale or a bid on our site; consequently, price will depend on fluctuations in our secondary market that are outside our control and potentially within the cancellation period set out in section [10.1] above.</p>

If we do not receive any response from you, you will be deemed to have abstained from the relevant vote. We will send reminders at appropriate intervals.

<h4>CESSATION PLANNING</h4>
<p>In the unlikely circumstance that Vairt were to cease business operations, the company's Cessation Plan (CP) will be initiated. Vairt's CP sets out contingency arrangements, including measures that have been put in place, to ensure the orderly administration of Investments in the event that Vairt ceases to carry on its business.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that Vairt is unable to operate on a permanent basis Vairt's CP will follow its CP.</p>
<p>If, at the time that the CP is initiated, and the majority decision of investors is to liquidate the investment, Vairt personnel will manage and oversee the sale of Property and the return of funds to investors proportionately. Where the investment returns a gain, the administration and liquidation costs will be borne by the return on investment (as would be the case in the case of a liquidation by way of normal business). If the liquidation of the Property results in a loss, Vairt will bear the administrative and liquidation costs. Vairt will not be responsible for any capital losses on the investment in the event that Property values decrease.</p>

<h4>FEES</h4>
<p>Vairt will charge a 4% transaction fee for arranging the investment at completion of the Property acquisition, such fee to be calculated on the Total Funding Target. This fee will be split in two traches. 1.5% will be billed at the time of the transaction and the remaining 2.5% will be billed at the time of the exit. The exit fee of 2.5% will be calculated on the greater of the Total Funding Target or the "Exit Value" (being he value at which the Property is sold at the end of the Investment Term).</p>
<p>There will be annual administrative fees of up to 10% of gross rent</p>
<p>We may waive or reduce our fee and/or offer cash-back for whatever reason, as long as permitted by the DFSA rules (which include treating customers fairly).</p>
<p>Transaction fees on all markets shall be rounded up to the nearest Dollar and the minimum fee per transaction shall be $ 1.</p>
<p>Vairt reserves the right to amend all of the aforementioned fees subject to providing notice to you at least 10 business days prior to amending the chargeable fee. Notice of a fee change will be provided to you by email.</p>
